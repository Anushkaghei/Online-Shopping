## Online shopping module using python(tkinter) and MySQL

<h2>Purpose</h2>
The pandemic has set up a new normal. Consumers are relying on the digital world more than ever and businesses are forced to adapt their strategies and shift toward digital transformation with much more urgency than before.
One of the major scenarios could be that consumers who were used to doing all their shopping in physical stores have gone through a personal transformation and will not return to their old shopping habits hence demanding a comprehensive system, which can capture, analyze and
evaluate the data.
This is a small scale project for creating a platform for an Online shopping module. 

<h2>Project Flow</h2>

The project mainly uses Tkinter as its GUI. Graphical User Interface(GUI) is a form of user interface which allows users to interact with computers through visual indicators using items such as icons, menus, windows, etc. It has advantages over the Command Line Interface(CLI) where users interact with computers by writing commands using keyboard only.

All transactions carried out by the users are stored in the MySQL database which is a part of the relational database management system (RDBMS). It refers to a database that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns. The module used to connect the python interface with the MySQL database is pymysql
